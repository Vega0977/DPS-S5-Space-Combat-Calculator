This folder contains all the ships in your game. Until the ship building GUI is setup, all ships have to be
specified manually with these files. In order to do that, make a copy of the Template file, name it something you can
remember, and then edit the file's information to match the ship you have in mind. Note that the file will not be able
to detect ship builds that are beyond the rules of the game, and will definitely break if you put something unexpected into it. 

Rules for making ships:

Fighter craft/strike craft are called things like Basic_Fighter_Craft and Advanced_Strike_Craft. !!: I used *advanced* not *improved* because i fucked up

Weapons and components are all named with underscores, not spaces.

(Important) Some things are given a full name for each possible variation. So put in Small_Blue_Laser, not Blue_Laser when
adding weapons, or Advanced_Line instead of just Line or Advanced when adding AI types.

They generally have every separate word capitalized.

There may be some spelling differences from the google sheet, such as 'Auxiliary' which is sometimes 'Auxilary' on the sheet. 

I have made some spelling errors. If it isn't working properly, you may have to let me know or try digging through the other files yourself.
